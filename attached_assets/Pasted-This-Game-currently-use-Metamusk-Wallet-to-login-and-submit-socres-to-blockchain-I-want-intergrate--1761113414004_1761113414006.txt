This Game Develop for "MetaMask Smart Accounts x Monad Dev Cook Off" Hackerthon Event

This is Qualification Requirements

The project should use MetaMask Smart Accounts. MetaMask Smart Accounts are signer agnostic, so you can use any wallet provider of your choice i.e. MetaMask extension, MetaMask Embedded Wallets, Dynamic or Privy.

The project should be deployed on the Monad testnet. If opting for the cross chain track, it should be Monad testnet. (RPC - https://rpc.ankr.com/monad_testnet)

To integrate MetaMask Smart Accounts use the Delegation Toolkit SDK.

The project demo video should have a working MetaMask Smart Accounts integration on Monad depicted in the main flow of the application.

The judges can decide not to reward a track prize if no project meets the standards set by them internally, apart from the basic submission criteria.

Envio Bonus requirements
To qualify for the Envio bounty, projects must demonstrably use Envio's infrastructure (e.g. HyperIndex or HyperSync) as a core part of their submission. It could be powering an indexer, enabling notifications, structuring data pipelines, or any other creative integration. Sufficient evidence of Envio usage includes, but is not limited to:

• A working indexer using Envio.

• Query and usage of HyperSync's API

• Queries or endpoints generated by Envio being consumed in the project.

• Documentation, code, or demos that show Envio actively supporting the project's functionality.
