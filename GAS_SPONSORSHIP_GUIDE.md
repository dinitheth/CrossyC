# Gas Sponsorship Guide for Crossy Chain

## Current Situation

Right now, your game is **not fully gasless** for users. Here's what's happening:

1. ‚úÖ **Pimlico Bundler**: Your game uses Pimlico to submit transactions (bundler service)
2. ‚ùå **No Paymaster**: Users still need MON tokens in their Smart Account to pay gas fees
3. üí° **The Smart Account**: When users connect, a separate Smart Account is created (different from their MetaMask wallet)

## Understanding the Components

### What is Pimlico?

**Pimlico** provides TWO services:

1. **Bundler Service** (‚úÖ You're already using this)
   - Submits ERC-4337 user operations to the blockchain
   - Handles smart account transactions
   - Your API key enables this

2. **Paymaster Service** (‚ùå Not currently enabled)
   - **Sponsors gas fees** so users don't pay anything
   - Requires setting up a sponsorship policy
   - Requires funding your paymaster balance

### Why Do Users Need MON in Their Smart Account?

- The Smart Account (e.g., `0x4B63...0441`) is a **separate blockchain account**
- It's linked to your MetaMask wallet but has its own address and balance
- Without a paymaster, this account needs MON tokens to pay for gas
- **This is why the transaction fails** - the Smart Account has 0 MON

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Enable Pimlico Paymaster (Recommended for Production)

This makes transactions **truly gasless** for your users - you sponsor the gas fees from your account.

#### Step 1: Set Up Pimlico Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.pimlico.io
2. Sign in with your account
3. Navigate to "Paymasters" section
4. Create a new **Sponsorship Policy** for Monad testnet
5. Add funds to your paymaster balance (you'll need to deposit funds)
6. Copy your **Sponsorship Policy ID** (looks like `sp_xxxxx`)

#### Step 2: Add Environment Variable

Add a new secret in Replit:
```
VITE_SPONSORSHIP_POLICY_ID=sp_your_policy_id_here
```

#### Step 3: Update Your Code

I can update the code to use the paymaster when available. The changes needed:

1. Create a paymaster client from Pimlico
2. Pass paymaster data when sending user operations
3. Remove the balance check (since paymaster will pay)

**Cost**: You pay for users' gas fees (around $0.01-0.10 per transaction on testnets)

---

### Option 2: Manual Funding (Quick Test)

For testing purposes, you can manually send MON tokens to the Smart Account:

1. Copy the Smart Account address (shown in the game's top-left when connected)
2. In MetaMask, send 0.1 MON from your regular wallet to the Smart Account address
3. Try submitting the score again

**Pros**: Quick to test
**Cons**: Every user needs to manually fund their Smart Account

---

### Option 3: Faucet Integration (For Hackathons/Testing)

Get testnet MON tokens from Monad faucet and send to Smart Accounts automatically:

1. Use Monad testnet faucet: https://www.monadexplorer.com/faucet
2. Request tokens for the Smart Account address
3. Users can then submit transactions

**Pros**: Free testnet tokens
**Cons**: Manual process, not suitable for production

## How Paymaster Works (Technical Details)

When you enable Pimlico's Verifying Paymaster:

```
User clicks "Submit Score"
    ‚Üì
Smart Account creates user operation
    ‚Üì
Pimlico Paymaster reviews the operation
    ‚Üì
Paymaster adds sponsorship signature
    ‚Üì
Pimlico Bundler submits to blockchain
    ‚Üì
‚úÖ Transaction confirmed (gas paid by YOUR paymaster balance)
```

## Cost Breakdown

### With Paymaster (Option 1)
- **User pays**: $0.00 (gasless!)
- **You pay**: ~$0.01-0.10 per transaction (your paymaster balance)
- **Best for**: Production apps, good UX

### Without Paymaster (Current State)
- **User pays**: Must fund Smart Account with MON
- **You pay**: $0.00
- **Best for**: Testing only (bad UX)

## Alternative Services

If Pimlico doesn't support Monad well, consider:

1. **Alchemy Gas Manager** - 8% markup, supports 100+ chains
2. **Thirdweb** - Flexible sponsorship
3. **Coinbase CDP Paymaster** - $100 free credits
4. **Circle Paymaster** - Users pay in USDC instead of native tokens

## Recommendations

### For Hackathon Demo
**Option 2** (Manual Funding) - Quick and simple:
- Just send 0.1 MON to your Smart Account before demos
- Shows the blockchain integration works

### For Production/Launch
**Option 1** (Enable Paymaster) - Professional UX:
- Set up proper gas sponsorship
- Users don't need to understand crypto
- Smooth onboarding experience

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:

1. **Enable Pimlico Paymaster** (requires your Sponsorship Policy ID)?
2. **Show you how to manually fund** your Smart Account for quick testing?
3. **Look into alternative paymaster services** that might work better with Monad?

Let me know which approach you'd prefer!
