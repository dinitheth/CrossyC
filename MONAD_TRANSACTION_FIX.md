# Monad Transaction Timeout Fix

## What's the Problem?

Your game is experiencing **2-minute timeouts** when submitting scores because:

1. **Pimlico's bundler is slow on Monad testnet** (or not fully supported)
2. **Smart Accounts add complexity** that might not be needed
3. **Monad testnet might be congested** or have slower block times

## What I've Fixed (Interim Solution)

✅ **Increased timeout to 5 minutes** (was ~2 minutes, now 300 seconds)  
✅ **Better error messages** explaining what's happening  
✅ **Pending transaction detection** to show helpful guidance  
✅ **Created a simpler alternative** (see below)

## The Root Cause

You're using **MetaMask Smart Accounts** with **Pimlico bundler**. This is a sophisticated setup that:
- Creates ERC-4337 user operations
- Submits them through Pimlico's bundler
- Waits for the bundler to process and confirm

**The problem**: Monad testnet might not be well-supported by Pimlico's infrastructure, causing very slow confirmations.

## Recommended Solution: Switch to Simple Wallet Transactions

I've created `client/src/lib/web3-simple.ts` which uses **regular MetaMask transactions** instead of Smart Accounts.

### Benefits of Simple Mode:
✅ **Much faster** - Direct blockchain transactions (5-10 seconds instead of 2+ minutes)  
✅ **More reliable** - No bundler dependency  
✅ **Simpler** - Users just approve in MetaMask  
✅ **Better Monad support** - Works with standard RPC  

### Drawbacks:
❌ No gasless transactions (users pay gas from their MetaMask wallet)  
❌ No Smart Account features (batching, etc.)  

## How to Switch to Simple Mode

I can update your game to use the simple approach. Here's what would change:

### Current Flow (Smart Account):
```
User connects → Smart Account created → User Op submitted → Bundler processes → ⏰ Long wait
```

### Simple Flow (Regular Wallet):
```
User connects → Regular wallet → Direct transaction → ✅ Quick confirmation
```

### Code Changes Needed:

**Option A: Full Switch (Recommended)**
Replace all Smart Account code with simple wallet transactions:
- Faster confirmations
- Better reliability on Monad
- Users pay gas directly from their MetaMask wallet

**Option B: Hybrid Approach**
Keep both and let users choose:
- "Fast Mode" - Regular transactions
- "Smart Account Mode" - Current setup (for gasless, if paymaster enabled)

## What Should We Do?

I recommend **Option A** for now because:

1. **Monad isn't well-supported** by Pimlico's bundler yet
2. **You don't have paymaster enabled** anyway (so no gasless benefit)
3. **Much better user experience** with faster transactions
4. **Simpler to maintain** and debug

Later, when Monad support improves or you need Smart Account features, we can add it back.

## Alternative: Fix the Smart Account Approach

If you want to keep Smart Accounts, here are options:

### 1. Use Monad's Native Bundler (if available)
- Check if Monad has its own bundler service
- Switch from Pimlico to Monad's infrastructure

### 2. Increase Timeout Further
- Current: 5 minutes
- Could try: 10 minutes
- **Downside**: Still bad UX

### 3. Enable Pimlico Paymaster
- If paymaster sponsors gas, bundler might prioritize
- **Downside**: Costs you money per transaction

### 4. Poll for Transaction Status
- Don't wait for receipt, just submit and show "pending"
- Let users check status later
- **Downside**: Uncertain confirmation

## Quick Test

Want to test the simple mode right now? I can:

1. Add a toggle in the UI to switch between modes
2. Switch entirely to simple mode
3. Keep Smart Accounts but add better retry logic

Which would you prefer?

## Current Status

The code improvements I've made:
- ✅ 5-minute timeout (gives more time)
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Pending transaction detection
- ✅ Simple wallet mode created (ready to use)

Next step is your decision on which approach to use!
